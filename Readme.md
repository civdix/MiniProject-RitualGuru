<!-- Hinduism or Sanatan Believe in Palmistry -->
Hasta Samudrika Shastra: This is the ancient Hindu science of palmistry

<!-- Christianity Believe In Palimstry -->

Christianity emphasizes that God's will and knowledge of the future are beyond human understanding, and attempting to predict the future through palmistry or similar practices is seen as contrary to trusting in God's plan.

Old Testament Laws: The Bible explicitly forbids practices related to divination, including palmistry, astrology, and other forms of fortune-telling:
(Sorcery is the practice of using magic or spells to influence events or people)
(An omen is a sign or event that is believed to predict or symbolize future events)
(Divination refers to the practice of seeking to gain insight or knowledge about the future)

"Let no one be found among you who... practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft..." (Deuteronomy 18:10-12, NIV)
Trust in God: Christianity teaches that God is the only one who knows the future and that believers should trust in His will rather than seeking knowledge through forbidden practices:

"The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever..." (Deuteronomy 29:29, NIV)
Jesus and Divination: In the New Testament, Jesus and the apostles never used palmistry or any similar methods to predict the future. Instead, faith in God and prayer are central to Christian teachings.


<!-- Islam Believe in Palistry -->
The Hadith on Divination: The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) discouraged practices like palmistry. In a well-known Hadith:

"Whoever goes to a fortune teller and asks him about anything, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days." (Sahih Muslim)

by this act we can have clue the in Previous time the influence of Palmistry was in Islam too but it considered to illegal and not aligned with Islamic feelings

Because in Islam holy book Quran Say, â€˜None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except Allah'
