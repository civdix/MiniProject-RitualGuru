## Christianity's View on Palmistry

Christianity emphasizes that God's will and knowledge of the future are beyond human understanding. Attempting to predict the future through palmistry or similar practices is seen as contrary to trusting in God's plan.

### Old Testament Laws
The Bible explicitly forbids practices related to divination, including palmistry, astrology, and other forms of fortune-telling:

- Sorcery is the practice of using magic or spells to influence events or people.
- An omen is a sign or event believed to predict or symbolize future events.
- Divination refers to seeking insight or knowledge about the future.

> "Let no one be found among you who... practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft..."  
> *(Deuteronomy 18:10-12, NIV)*

### Trust in God
Christianity teaches that God is the only one who knows the future, and believers should trust in His will rather than seeking knowledge through forbidden practices:

> "The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever..."  
> *(Deuteronomy 29:29, NIV)*

### Jesus and Divination
In the New Testament, Jesus and the apostles never used palmistry or similar methods to predict the future. Instead, faith in God and prayer are central to Christian teachings.

## Islam's View on Palmistry

### The Hadith on Divination
The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) discouraged practices like palmistry. In a well-known Hadith:

> "Whoever goes to a fortune teller and asks him about anything, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days."  
> *(Sahih Muslim)*

This indicates that in earlier times, the influence of palmistry was present in Islamic societies, but it was considered illegal and misaligned with Islamic teachings.

### The Quran on the Unseen
The Quran states:

> "None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except Allah."  
> *(Surah An-Naml 27:65)*
